<p><pre>
	<b>An anonymous function is just a function that has no name; nothing more. 
	A closure is a function that captures the state of the surrounding environment.

	An anonymous function does not necessarily need to create a closure, and a closure 
	is not created only for anonymous functions.

	Consider this hypothetical counter-example. Consider a language Foo which does not support 
	closures but supports anonymous functions. This language may either not compile or throw an 
	error for the code below because "greeting" is not defined in the scope of the inner function. 
	The fact that it is anonymous is irrelevant.</b>
